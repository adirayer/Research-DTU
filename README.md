# Research-DTU
During my Internship I learned about various AI/ML models and finally completed AI/Machine Learning based Real Time accident Detection Project under Dr.S.Indu (Professor, DTU,Delhi). I implemented the Faster RCNN using Tensor-flow for real time Accident Detection and studies various other modeks for real time detection of objects.

The trained model and the dataset used are not included in the repository.
